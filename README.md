# Overview

This repository contains examples of how to use the Glue42 Dash library. For convenience, the setup is created with pure Python. Each example is individually separated and logically grouped in a folder.

[!NOTE]
The tutorial code in this repository is only to be used as an example and an educational source. It is not guaranteed to be production-ready or kept up to date with respect to vulnerabilities and out of date dependencies.

# Documentation

For more information on how to use the Glue42 Dash library, see the [official documentation](https://docs.glue42.com/getting-started/how-to/glue42-enable-your-app/dash/index.html).

# Setup

1. Use the Python >= 3.7. You can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to easily manage Python versions on your machine.

2. Setup and activate Python virtual environment in the root folder (more detailed instructions on how to setup Dash can be found [here](https://dash.plotly.com/installation)):

```sh
python -m virtualenv venv

# Unix
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Virtual Environment activation

```sh
# Unix
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

# Run example

1. [Setup](#setup) and active the [virtual environment](#virtual-environment-activation).

2. Basic examples contain one or more Dash or JavaScript applications. There is also an `index.html` to help preview the applications in [**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/). Go to an example folder (e.g. `/interop/register-invoke-method`) and run the following:

```sh
# Unix
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_APP=run.py

# Windows
set FLASK_ENV=development
set FLASK_APP=run.py

python -m flask run
```

## Glue42 Core 

To view an example running in [**Glue42 Core**](https://glue42.com/core/) environment, open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

## Glue42 Enterprise

To run the applications of an example in a [**Glue42 Enterprise**](https://glue42.com/enterprise/) environment, make sure you have Glue42 3.9 (or later) installed. Add the `apps-config.json` file located in the example folder to your [application configuration](https://docs.glue42.com/developers/configuration/application/index.html#application_configuration) files. Launch the applications from the Glue42 Toolbar.

## Additional Details

In these examples, the [Dash Dev Tools](https://dash.plotly.com/devtools) features are turned off. 
You can easily enable them by executing `app.enable_dev_tools()` on the app instance.
